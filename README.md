# Fragger
A disk fragmenter for FAT16 disk images. Yes, you read that right - not defragmenter - fragmenter. It scrambles FAT16 disk images to be as annoying and slow to read from as possible.

Right now, it only works on disks that aren't full. For a full disk, it uses a different algorithm which currently breaks and totally scambles the clusters.

If you want to actually use it, you'll need to set it back to the first algorithm - it doesn't automatically switch at the moment.
